# Chapter 3: Transport Layer


> transport layer -- extending the network layer’s delivery service between two end systems to a delivery service between two application layer processes running on the end systems.


## 3.1 Transport-Layer Services

- The transport layer resides between the application and network layers, providing communication services to application processes on different hosts.
- Transport layer protocols enable `logical communication` between application processes on different hosts, abstracting the physical infrastructure.
- It converts application messages into transport layer `segments`, encapsulated within network layer packets (datagrams) for transmission.
- Transport protocols work only within end systems and are not involved in routing or network core activities.
- These protocol provides communication between application **processes**, while network layer protocol provides communication between **hosts**.

-  IP makes its “best effort” to deliver segments between communicating hosts, but it makes no guarantees. (IP is said to be an unreliable service)

> The most fundamental responsibility of UDP and TCP is to extend IP’s delivery service between two end systems to a delivery service between two processes running on the end systems. Extending host-to-host delivery to process-to-process delivery is called transport layer multiplexing and demultiplexing.


- Key Differences in UDP vs TCP Protocols:

| Aspect                      | UDP (User Datagram Protocol)        | TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)      |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Service Model               | Unreliable and connectionless    | Reliable and connection-oriented         |
| Application Selection       | Chosen by the application developer | Chosen by the application developer    |
| Terminology                | Uses "datagram" for segments     | Uses "segment" for segments             |
| Network Layer Protocol     | Operates on top of IP (Internet Protocol) | Operates on top of IP (Internet Protocol) |
| Services Provided          | Process to process data delivery and error checking | Reliable data transfer, flow control, sequence numbers, acknowledgments, timers, and congestion control |
| Reliability                 | Unreliable - Does not guarantee data integrity or delivery | Reliable - Ensures data delivery, integrity, and order |
| Congestion Control         | Unregulated - No congestion control | Regulated - Prevents excessive traffic and aims for fair sharing of network resources |
| Complexity                  | Simpler and less complex         | Complex due to additional services and mechanisms |

## 3.2 Multiplexing and Demultiplexing

- **Objective**: Extend host-to-host delivery to process-to-process delivery for applications.

### Demultiplexing

- Transport layer delivers data to an intermediary socket, not directly to a process.
- Each socket has a unique identifier. Fields in a transport layer segment are used to identify these receiving socket.
- Demultiplexing directs the segment to the corresponding socket, ensuring data is delivered to the correct process.
- In the household analogy, this is similar to handing out mail to the right person based on the address.

### Multiplexing

- Multiplexing involves gathering data from different sockets, encapsulating it with header information to create segments, and passing the segments to the network layer.
