# Transport Services (TCP & UDP):
**Responsibilities of a Transport Layer**
* The Process to Process Delivery
* End-to-End Connection between Hosts
* Multiplexing and Demultiplexing
* Congestion Control
* Data integrity and Error correction
* Flow control

## What is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)?
TCP is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite. It lies between the Application and Network Layers which are used in providing reliable delivery services. It is a connection-oriented protocol for communications that helps in the exchange of messages between different devices over a network.

**Features of TCP**
* TCP keeps track of the segments being transmitted or received by assigning numbers to every single one of them.
* Flow control limits the rate at which a sender transfers data. This is done to ensure reliable delivery.
* TCP implements an error control mechanism for reliable data transfer.
* TCP takes into account the level of congestion in the network.

### Applications of TCP
* World Wide Web (WWW) : When you browse websites, TCP ensures reliable data transfer between your browser and web servers.
* Email : TCP is used for sending and receiving emails. Protocols like SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) handle email delivery across servers.
* File Transfer Protocol (FTP) : FTP relies on TCP to transfer large files securely. Whether you’re uploading or downloading files, TCP ensures data integrity.
* Secure Shell (SSH) : SSH sessions, commonly used for remote administration, rely on TCP for encrypted communication between client and server.
* Streaming Media : Services like Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify use TCP to stream videos and music. It ensures smooth playback by managing data segments and retransmissions.
#### Advantages of TCP
* It is reliable for maintaining a connection between Sender and Receiver.
* It is responsible for sending data in a particular sequence.
* Its operations are not dependent on Operating System .
* It allows and supports many routing protocols.
* It can reduce the speed of data based on the speed of the receiver.
#### Disadvantages of TCP
* It is slower than UDP and it takes more bandwidth.
* Slower upon starting of transfer of a file.
* Not suitable for LAN and PAN Networks.
* It does not have a multicast or broadcast category.
* It does not load the whole page if a single data of the page is missing.
