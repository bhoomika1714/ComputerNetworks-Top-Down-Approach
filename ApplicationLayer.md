# Transport Services (TCP & UDP):
**Responsibilities of a Transport Layer**
* The Process to Process Delivery
* End-to-End Connection between Hosts
* Multiplexing and Demultiplexing
* Congestion Control
* Data integrity and Error correction
* Flow control

## What is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)?
TCP is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite. It lies between the Application and Network Layers which are used in providing reliable delivery services. It is a connection-oriented protocol for communications that helps in the exchange of messages between different devices over a network.

**Features of TCP**
* TCP keeps track of the segments being transmitted or received by assigning numbers to every single one of them.
* Flow control limits the rate at which a sender transfers data. This is done to ensure reliable delivery.
* TCP implements an error control mechanism for reliable data transfer.
* TCP takes into account the level of congestion in the network.
